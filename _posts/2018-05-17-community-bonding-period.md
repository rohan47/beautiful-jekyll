I was really excited on getting seleted for GSoC 2018. Here is the link to [my project abstract](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5926207925780480).
My mentors are Jared Watts and Travis Nielsen. Both of them are super cool and they help me a lot. They are the best mentors.

I started late for the community bonding period as I had my final semester exams till 5th of May and i informed my mentors about it.

Bellow are the tasks that i was to take care during Community Bonding Period:
- [ x ] Join the Slack community.
- [ x ] Attend one of the community meetings.
- [ x ] Get development environment and tools set up.
- [ x ] Build local changes to produce runnable artifacts.
- [ x ] Run locally built code in Minikube environment.
- [ x ] Run and pass unit and integration tests.
- [ x ] Submit a pull request, integrate feedback and have it approved and merged to master.

I opened this [pull request](https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/1614) which resolved [this issue](https://github.com/rook/rook/issues/1502).

I compleated my other tasks so i started working on the design doc which was supposed to be done in the coding period and I discussed that in the Rook community meeting.
I read a lot about Kubernetes concepts regarding storage and NFS during this period.

Here are few videos that are very much helpful:
