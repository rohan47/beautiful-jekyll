Hey there,

I am Rohan. Currently I am working at Red Hat as an intern. I participated as a student developer for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a part of Google Summer of Code 2018 and worked on [Rook](https://rook.io) project.  
I love linux.  
I am very much interested in system programming and distributed systems. I code in Go, Python and C.

I am looking for a Job, and i will be availabe to join from April 2019. Here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dm3v4gq4ILi7KnicML-j7ZdmcZH18f9T).

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now.
