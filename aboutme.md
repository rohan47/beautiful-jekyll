Hey there,

I am Rohan. Currently I am a student developer for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a part of Google Summer of Code 2018 working on [Rook](https://rook.io) project.  
I love linux.  
I am very much interested in system programming and distributed systems. I code in Go, Python and C.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now.
