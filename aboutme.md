Hey there,

I am Rohan, an undergraduate from UEM Jaipur. Currently I am Google Summer of Code (2018) student for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) working on [rook](https://rook.io) project.
I love linux.
I am very much interested in system programming and distributed systems. I code in Go, Python and C.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now.
